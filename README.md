## Database Projects

### 🗂️ Hybrid Vector Search with Metadata Synopses
Imagine searching for a product on Amazon, for example, a *"tumbler with a floral motif"* priced $10–$30 and highly rated. This project builds a **hybrid vector search system** that combines **text embeddings** with **metadata filters** to handle this type of filtered product search efficiently. The system achieves **baseline-level recall** while running **10% faster** than standard approaches.

## LLM Projects

### 🗂️ COA File Extraction & ERP Integration Pipeline
A manufacture company deal with hundreds of COA documents every week, each full of important details like allergens, microbials, heavy metals, and lot information. Finding answers like whether a product contains an allergen requires digging through multiple COAs by hand, which is slow and error-prone. This project automates that entire workflow by downloading COAs, extracting text with OCR, parsing the key fields with GPT-4o-mini, validating the results, and sending the cleaned data directly into the Deacom ERP. Teams can now look up material specifications instantly without manually reading any documents.

### 🗂️ Conversational Movie Recommender 
A conversational movie recommendation system built using **few-shot prompting with LLaMA 3** on the TG-ReDial dataset. Instead of directly outputting a movie title, the model learns to **embed recommendations naturally within a dialogue**, taking into account user profiles, conversation topics, history, and ground-truth target movies.

### 🗂️ Pivot-Based Translation for Low-Resource Languages
This project explores practical strategies for improving translation quality in low-resource language pairs. Implements pivot-based translation between Nepali ↔ Sinhala using English as the intermediary language. Built with the NLLB-200 model and the FLORES-200 dataset, the system translates Nepali → English → Sinhala (and vice versa) and evaluates performance with SacreBLEU, ChrF, and BLEURT metrics.

## ML/DL Projects
### 🗂️ Outage Prediction for Telecommunications Networks
Built machine learning models to predict network outages using 10M+ customer interaction records from a telecom provider. Trained and evaluated logistic regression and neural network models on short-term (7-day) and long-term (90-day) windows, achieving up to 0.94 AUC and 97% accuracy. Identified operational signals such as work order volume and rolling activity spikes as the strongest predictors.
