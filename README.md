## 🔎 Database Projects

### <mark style="background-color: #d3e5ff;">Hybrid Vector Search with Metadata Synopses</mark>
Imagine searching for a product on Amazon — for example, a *"tumbler with a floral motif"* priced $10–$30 and highly rated. This project builds a **hybrid vector search system** that combines **text embeddings** with **metadata filters** to handle this type of filtered product search efficiently. The system achieves **baseline-level recall** while running **10% faster** than standard approaches.

## 🤖 LLM Projects

### COA File Extraction & ERP Integration Pipeline
Manufacturers deal with hundreds of COA documents every week, each full of important details like allergens, microbials, heavy metals, and lot information. Finding answers like whether a product contains an allergen requires digging through multiple COAs by hand, which is slow and error-prone. This project automates that entire workflow by downloading COAs, extracting text with OCR, parsing the key fields with GPT-4o-mini, validating the results, and sending the cleaned data directly into the Deacom ERP. Teams can now look up material specifications instantly without manually reading any documents.

### Conversational Movie Recommender 
A conversational movie recommendation system built using **few-shot prompting with LLaMA 3** on the TG-ReDial dataset. Instead of directly outputting a movie title, the model learns to **embed recommendations naturally within a dialogue**, taking into account user profiles, conversation topics, history, and ground-truth target movies.
