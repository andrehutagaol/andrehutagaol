## 🔎 Database Projects

**Hybrid Vector Search with Metadata Synopses**  
**Description:** Imagine searching for a product on Amazon — for example, a *"tumbler with a floral motif"* priced $10–$30 and highly rated. This project builds a **hybrid vector search system** that combines **text embeddings** with **metadata filters** to handle this type of filtered product search efficiently. The system achieves **baseline-level recall** while running **10–30× faster** than standard approaches.

## 🤖 LLM Projects

**Conversational Movie Recommender**  
**Description:** A conversational movie recommendation system built using **few-shot prompting with LLaMA 3** on the TG-ReDial dataset. Instead of directly outputting a movie title, the model learns to **embed recommendations naturally within a dialogue**, taking into account user profiles, conversation topics, history, and ground-truth target movies.
