# Hybrid Vector Search with Metadata Synopses  

This project tackles a common product search scenario on e-commerce platforms like Amazon: users want to find products using both free text descriptions and metadata filters. For example, a user might search for *"a tumbler that has a floral motif"* while filtering by category (Home & Kitchen), minimum rating (4+ stars), and price range ($10–$30).  

The **hybrid vector search** achieves **baseline-level recall** with **10–30× faster query times** on the Amazon Product Dataset.
