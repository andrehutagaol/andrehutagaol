## 📂 Projects I've Done So Far

## 🔎 Database Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hybrid Vector Search with Metadata Synopses** | Imagine searching for a product on Amazon — e.g., a *"tumbler with a floral motif"*, priced $10–$30, and highly rated. This project builds a hybrid vector search system that combines text embeddings + metadata filters to dramatically speed up filtered search. It achieves baseline-level recall while running 10–30× faster than standard approaches. <br> [Project Repo](https://github.com/andrehutagaol/hybrid_search) |

## 🤖 LLM Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Movie Recommendation with Prompt-Based Methods** | A conversational movie recommender using few-shot prompting with LLaMA 3 on the TG-ReDial dataset. Instead of directly stating the movie name, the system learns to naturally embed the recommendation within dialogue using user profiles, discussion topics, conversation history, and ground truth targets. <br> [Project Repo](https://github.com/andrehutagaol/conversational-movie-recommender) |
